   "source": [
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "the states are organized into a hierarchical delegation pattern with distinct responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "the top level is the AgentState. this contains overall conversation messages, research brief, accumulated notes, and the final report. the scope manages the entire research workflow from user input to final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "the middle level is the SupervisorState. this contains the supervisor's messages, research iterations, and coordination logic. the scope manages delegation strategy, and spawns parallel researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "the lowest level is the ResearcherState. this contains the individual message history, tool call iterations, and research findings. the scope focuses on narrow research on a specific assigned topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "it's not a great idea to use a single, huge state. it's best to have scope isolation, in which each researcher operates independently with its own message history and tool iterations. this prevents state pollution where one researcher's context affects another. the supervisor doesn't need to track every tool call from every researcher. each level has different iteration controls, which wouldn't make sense in a single state. \n",
    "\n",
    "with multiple independent states, one can also execute in parallel. multiple researcher subgraphs run simultaneously. each researcher needs isolated state to avoid race conditions. separate states enable true parallelism without complex locking mechanisms. \n",
    "\n",
    "each state has a clear, single responsibility. easier to debug issues at specific levels (is it a supervisor planning problem or researcher execution problem?). cleaner node function signatures - nodes only receive the state they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "it's also a factor of reusability and token management.\n",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "***advantages***:\n",
    "\n",
    "single source of truth. each component is defined once and used everywhere. bug fixes or improvements propagate automatically to all consumers. no risk of different versions of the same logic existing in different files. changes to behavior happen in exactly one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "separation of concerns. state definitions live in state.py and are only concerned with data structures. prompts live in prompts.py and are only concerned with llm instructions. node logic lives in deep_researcher.py and is only concerned with workflow. each module has a single, well-defined responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "dependency management. explicit imports make dependencies visible and trackable. easy to see what each component needs (import statements at top). can manage versions of components independently. enables proper package management and distribution. this also increases code readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "scalability and maintainability. adding a new researcher type means importing existing components, not copying code. multiple teams can work on different modules without conflicts. refactoring is localized. change one module, imports handle the rest. reduces cognitive load. don’t need to understand all code, just interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "testing and quality assurance. can unit test each module independently. mock imports for isolated testing. ensure components work correctly before integration. regression testing catches breaking changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "abstraction and encapsulation. implementation details hidden behind clean interfaces. consumers don’t need to know how components work, just what they do. can change internal implementation without affecting consumers. reduces coupling between different parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***disadvantages***:\n",
    "\n",
    "tight coupling risk. importing creates dependencies. if the library changes, all consumers may break. versioning becomes critical to prevent breaking changes. need semantic versioning and deprecation strategies. circular dependencies can emerge if not carefully managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "abstraction overhead. must design proper interfaces and apis. over abstraction can make simple things complicated. need to think about backwards compatibility. documentation becomes critical for usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "dependency hell. transitive dependencies can conflict. version incompatibilities between different consumers. deployment complexity increases with more dependencies. security vulnerabilities in dependencies affect all consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "debugging complexity. errors may occur deep in imported modules. harder to trace execution flow across module boundaries. need good logging and error handling strategies. stack traces span multiple files/modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "initial  development overhead. requires upfront design of module boundaries. more structure and boilerplate than inline code. need to think about api stability from the start. may slow initial prototyping.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Choose one prompt template (clarify, brief, supervisor, researcher, compression, or final report)\n",
    "2. Explain what the prompt is designed to accomplish\n",
    "3. Identify 2-3 key techniques used in the prompt (e.g., structured output, role definition, examples)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Location:** Lines 79-136 in `open_deep_library/prompts.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What the Prompt is Designed to Accomplish\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor prompt transforms the LLM into a research manager that strategically delegates research tasks to specialized sub-agents. Its primary goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strategic decomposition** - Analyze a research brief and decide how to break it into focused sub-tasks\n",
    "- **Resource management** - Make intelligent decisions about parallelization (when to use 1 vs. multiple researchers)\n",
    "- **Progress monitoring** - Assess after each delegation whether enough information has been gathered\n",
    "- **Termination control** - Know when to stop delegating and signal completion via `ResearchComplete`\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt sits at the heart of the hierarchical delegation architecture and determines the entire research strategy and workflow efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Key Techniques Used in the Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique #1: Structured Tool-Use Constraints with Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt enforces a ReAct-style reflection pattern where the supervisor must use `think_tool` before calling `ConductResearch` to plan its approach, and after each delegation to assess progress. By prohibiting parallel `think_tool` calls with other tools, it creates a sequential \"plan → act → reflect → decide\" loop that prevents impulsive delegation and ensures thoughtful resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique #2: Hard Limits with Clear Budget Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt establishes explicit resource boundaries including a \"bias towards single agent\" principle, stopping when the answer is confident, and limiting total tool calls to `max_researcher_iterations`. It also caps parallel agents at `max_concurrent_research_units` per iteration. This nudges the model toward simplicity unless parallelization is clearly beneficial, addressing the common agentic system issue of over-delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technique #3: Concrete Scaling Rules with Pattern-Matched Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt provides heuristic guidance with concrete examples that teach pattern recognition. For simple fact-finding, lists, and rankings, it shows using a single sub-agent (e.g., \"List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco → Use 1 sub-agent\"). For comparisons, it demonstrates using one sub-agent per element (e.g., \"Compare OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. DeepMind → Use 3 sub-agents\"). This helps the model recognize research archetypes and apply appropriate delegation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Suggested Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a cost-aware delegation section that monitors information quality versus quantity. The improvement would include guidance on recognizing diminishing returns (when the last delegation added little new information) and adapting strategy based on early findings. For exploratory questions, bias toward breadth with parallel researchers; for fact-checking, use a single focused researcher. The model should learn to detect when research is \"good enough\" rather than always exhausting its iteration budget, making the system more cost-effective in production environments."

However, I can provide you with a comprehensive sleep improvement plan based on established sleep science principles that directly address your three main issues: inconsistent bedtimes, phone usage in bed, and morning fatigue.\n",

       "## Understanding Your Sleep Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "Your current sleep pattern reveals three interconnected problems that are well-documented in sleep medicine research. Inconsistent bedtimes disrupt your circadian rhythm, which is your body's internal biological clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Phone usage in bed exposes you to blue light that suppresses melatonin production and creates cognitive stimulation when your brain should be winding down. Morning fatigue despite adequate sleep duration often indicates poor sleep quality rather than insufficient sleep quantity.\n",

       "\n",
       "### Consistent Sleep Timing\n",
       "\n",
       "The most critical intervention for your situation is establishing a consistent bedtime and wake time, even on weekends. Your current 3-hour window of bedtime variability (10pm-1am) significantly disrupts your circadian rhythm. Choose a realistic bedtime that accommodates your lifestyle - if you frequently stay up until midnight or 1am due to work or social obligations, don't set an unrealistic 10pm target initially.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Implementation Strategy:**\n",
       "- Choose a target bedtime (consider 11:30pm as a middle ground)\n",
       "- Set a \"wind-down alarm\" 1 hour before bedtime\n",
       "- Gradually shift your current bedtime by 15-30 minutes earlier each week until you reach your target\n",
       "- Maintain the same wake time every day, regardless of when you fell asleep\n",
       "\n",
       "### Light Exposure Management\n",
       "\n",
       "Light is the most powerful circadian rhythm regulator. Proper light exposure timing can significantly improve your sleep-wake cycle consistency.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Morning Light Exposure:**\n",
       "- Get bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking\n",

    "speed and efficiency. multiple researchers work simultaneously on different aspects of the research question. much faster than sequential section processing. configurable parallelism (1-20 concurrent researchers via max_concurrent_research_units).\n",
    "\n",
    "dynamic task decomposition. supervisor can break down research based on the actual question, not predefined sections. adapts to different research types: comparisons, lists, deep dives. research structure emerges organically from the question itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "independent investigation. each researcher explores a distinct sub-topic without waiting for others. natural parallelization for comparison tasks (e.g., “compare openai vs. anthropic vs. deepmind” spawns 3 parallel researchers). each researcher can use different tool combinations and strategies.\n",

    "***parallel researchers - disadvantages***:\n",

    "higher cost. multiple llm instances running simultaneously consume more tokens. each researcher has separate message histories and tool calls. compression is required for each researcher to prevent token overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "increased complexity. more moving parts than sequential approaches. requires supervisor coordination logic to manage delegation. need for state isolation to prevent race conditions.\n",

    "unpredictability. research structure emerges dynamically rather than following a predefined plan. harder to estimate total cost and completion time. may over-delegate if the supervisor isn’t properly constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "***sequential research - advantages***:\n",
    "\n",
    "token efficiency. single researcher context means fewer total tokens consumed. information from earlier research can inform later searches without redundancy. better for budget-constrained scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "predictable structure. template-based content with predefined sections. easier to estimate cost and completion time. clear linear progression through research phases.\n",

    "\n",
    "***sequential research - disadvantages***:\n",
    "\n",
    "slower execution. must complete each research phase before starting the next. total time is the sum of all research phases. no parallelization benefits.\n",

       "# Comprehensive Guide to Managing Chronic Lower Back Pain for Desk Workers\n",
       "\n",
       "Chronic lower back pain affects millions of office workers worldwide, with prolonged sitting being a primary contributing factor. This comprehensive guide addresses evidence-based strategies across three critical areas: targeted exercises, ergonomic workspace optimization, and supportive lifestyle modifications. Each recommendation is grounded in medical research and professional expertise to provide safe, effective solutions for managing and preventing desk-related lower back pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Exercise Interventions for Desk Worker Lower Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Quick Break Exercises (5-10 Minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pelvic Tilts and Cat-Cow Stretches**\n",
       "These exercises specifically target the lumbar spine's mobility and help counteract the flexed posture maintained during prolonged sitting. Pelvic tilts activate the deep core muscles while reducing excessive lumbar lordosis that develops from poor sitting posture [1]. The cat-cow movement promotes spinal segmental motion, which becomes restricted during static sitting positions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Perform 10-15 pelvic tilts every 2 hours, focusing on slow, controlled movement. For cat-cow stretches, move through 8-10 repetitions, holding each position for 2-3 seconds to maximize spinal mobility benefits.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Hip Flexor Stretches**\n",
       "Prolonged sitting causes adaptive shortening of the hip flexors, particularly the psoas muscle, which attaches to the lumbar vertebrae. Tight hip flexors create anterior pelvic tilt and increased lumbar extension, contributing to lower back pain [2]. Standing hip flexor stretches directly address this mechanical dysfunction.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Hold each stretch for 30-60 seconds, performing 2-3 repetitions per leg. Focus on maintaining an upright torso and avoiding compensatory lumbar extension during the stretch.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Seated Spinal Twists and Back Extensions**\n",
       "These exercises promote spinal mobility in planes of movement that are typically restricted during desk work. Seated twists address rotational stiffness while back extensions counter the prolonged flexed posture [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "Contraindications: Individuals with acute disc herniation or severe spinal stenosis should avoid aggressive twisting movements and consult a healthcare provider before performing these exercises.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Comprehensive Workout Routines (30-45 Minutes)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Core Strengthening Protocol**\n",
       "Research demonstrates that individuals with chronic lower back pain often have decreased activation and endurance of deep core muscles, including the transverse abdominis and multifidus [4]. A structured core strengthening program addresses these deficits through progressive exercises.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key exercises include:\n",
       "- Plank progressions (starting with 20-30 seconds, advancing to 60+ seconds)\n",
       "- Dead bug exercises (8-12 repetitions per side)\n",
       "- Bird dog holds (20-30 second holds, 6-8 repetitions per side)\n",
       "- Modified side planks (15-30 second holds)\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Perform this routine 3-4 times per week, focusing on quality over quantity. Progress gradually by increasing hold times or repetitions by 10-20% weekly.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Posterior Chain Strengthening**\n",
       "Desk workers commonly develop weakened gluteal muscles and upper back muscles due to prolonged sitting and forward head posture. Strengthening these muscle groups helps restore proper movement patterns and reduces compensatory stress on the lower back [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "Essential exercises include:\n",
       "- Glute bridges and single-leg glute bridges\n",
       "- Clamshells with resistance bands\n",
       "- Rows using resistance bands or weights\n",
       "- Wall slides for upper back activation\n",
       "\n",
       "**Flexibility and Mobility Routine**\n",
       "Systematic stretching addresses the muscle imbalances created by prolonged sitting. Focus areas include hip flexors, hamstrings, thoracic spine, and chest muscles [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "Key stretches:\n",
       "- Standing hip flexor stretch (60-90 seconds per side)\n",
       "- Seated forward fold for hamstrings\n",
       "- Doorway chest stretch\n",
       "- Thoracic spine mobility exercises\n",
       "\n",
       "Risks and Considerations: Avoid aggressive stretching when experiencing acute pain. Individuals with disc pathology should be particularly cautious with forward bending movements and consider working with a physical therapist for exercise modification.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Ergonomic Workspace Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "### Chair Setup and Positioning\n",
       "\n",
       "**Proper Lumbar Support**\n",
       "Research from the International Ergonomics Association indicates that chairs with adjustable lumbar support significantly reduce disc pressure and muscle activity in the lower back [7]. The lumbar support should maintain the natural S-curve of the spine, positioned at the level of the L3-L5 vertebrae.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Adjust the lumbar support to fit the curve of your lower back, approximately 4-6 inches above the seat. If your chair lacks adequate lumbar support, consider a lumbar roll or cushion that provides firm, consistent support.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Seat Height and Depth**\n",
       "Optimal seat height allows feet to rest flat on the floor with knees at approximately 90 degrees. This position minimizes pressure on the back of the thighs and reduces strain on the lumbar spine [8]. Seat depth should allow 2-3 fingers of space between the back of the knees and the seat edge.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Armrest Positioning**\n",
       "Properly adjusted armrests reduce upper body weight bearing through the spine and prevent forward head posture. Armrests should support the forearms with shoulders in a relaxed, neutral position [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Desk and Monitor Configuration\n",
       "\n",
       "**Monitor Height and Distance**\n",
       "The top of the monitor should be at or slightly below eye level to maintain neutral cervical spine alignment. Poor monitor positioning contributes to forward head posture, which increases cervical lordosis and can refer pain to the lower back through fascial connections [10].\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Position the monitor 20-26 inches from your eyes, with the screen tilted slightly backward (10-20 degrees) to reduce neck flexion. For dual monitor setups, position the primary monitor directly in front and the secondary monitor at a slight angle.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Keyboard and Mouse Placement**\n",
       "Input devices should be positioned to maintain neutral wrist alignment and allow the shoulders to remain relaxed. The keyboard should be at elbow height or slightly below, with the mouse positioned at the same level [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Ergonomic Accessories\n",
       "\n",
       "**Standing Desk Converters**\n",
       "Alternating between sitting and standing reduces static loading on the spine and activates postural muscles. Research suggests that breaking up prolonged sitting with standing intervals can reduce lower back discomfort by up to 32% [12].\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Start with 15-30 minute standing intervals every 1-2 hours. Gradually increase standing time as tolerance improves. Ensure the standing workstation maintains proper monitor height and allows for neutral arm positioning.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Footrests and Anti-Fatigue Mats**\n",
       "For individuals who cannot achieve proper foot positioning due to desk height constraints, footrests provide necessary support to maintain optimal sitting posture. Anti-fatigue mats for standing workstations reduce lower extremity fatigue and encourage subtle movements [13].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Document Holders and Ergonomic Keyboards**\n",
       "Document holders positioned at monitor height reduce neck flexion during reference tasks. Ergonomic keyboards that allow for natural wrist positioning can indirectly benefit overall posture by reducing upper extremity tension.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Lifestyle Modifications for Lower Back Health\n",
       "\n",
       "### Movement and Activity Patterns\n",
       "\n",
       "**Regular Movement Breaks**\n",
       "The human spine is designed for movement, not prolonged static positioning. Research demonstrates that micro-breaks every 30 minutes can significantly reduce the accumulation of spinal disc pressure and muscle fatigue [14]. These breaks should involve standing, walking, or performing simple movements that counteract the sitting posture.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementation: Set hourly reminders to stand and move for 2-3 minutes. Use bathroom breaks, water refills, or brief walks to naturally incorporate movement into the workday. Consider walking meetings when appropriate to combine productivity with activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Active Commuting and Transportation**\n",
       "When possible, incorporating walking or cycling into the commute provides valuable movement time and helps prepare the body for or recover from prolonged sitting. Even parking farther away or taking stairs instead of elevators contributes to daily movement goals [15].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sleep and Recovery Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sleep Position and Mattress Selection**\n",
       "Sleep quality directly impacts pain perception and tissue recovery. For individuals with lower back pain, sleep position can significantly affect morning stiffness and daily symptoms. Side sleeping with a pillow between the knees maintains spinal alignment, while back sleeping with a pillow under the knees reduces lumbar extension [16].\n",
       "\n",
       "Mattress considerations: Medium-firm mattresses generally provide optimal support for the lower back, though individual preferences may vary. The mattress should maintain spinal alignment while allowing for pressure point relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sleep Hygiene for Pain Management**\n",
       "Poor sleep quality can amplify pain perception and reduce the body's natural healing processes. Establishing consistent sleep schedules, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and limiting screen exposure before bedtime support restorative sleep [17].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Stress Management and Mental Health\n",
       "\n",
       "**Stress-Pain Connection**\n",
       "Chronic stress contributes to muscle tension, particularly in the back and neck regions. Additionally, stress can amplify pain perception and reduce pain tolerance. Effective stress management techniques can directly impact physical symptoms [18].\n",
       "\n",
       "Evidence-based stress reduction methods include:\n",
       "- Mindfulness meditation (10-20 minutes daily)\n",
       "- Progressive muscle relaxation\n",
       "- Regular physical activity outside of work\n",
       "- Social connection and support systems\n",
       "\n",
       "### Nutritional Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "**Anti-Inflammatory Nutrition**\n",
       "Chronic inflammation can contribute to persistent pain and delayed tissue healing. An anti-inflammatory diet emphasizing omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and whole foods may support pain management efforts [19].\n",
       "\n",
       "Key nutritional strategies:\n",
       "- Increase intake of fatty fish, nuts, and seeds\n",
       "- Emphasize colorful fruits and vegetables\n",
       "- Limit processed foods and excessive sugar\n",
       "- Maintain adequate hydration (8-10 glasses of water daily)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Weight Management**\n",
       "Excess weight, particularly around the midsection, increases mechanical stress on the lumbar spine and can contribute to postural dysfunction. Even modest weight loss can significantly reduce lower back pain in overweight individuals [20].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Implementation Timeline and Monitoring\n",
       "\n",
       "**Gradual Implementation Strategy**\n",
       "Attempting to implement all recommendations simultaneously can be overwhelming and unsustainable. A phased approach allows for habit formation and reduces the risk of abandoning beneficial changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Week 1-2: Focus on basic ergonomic adjustments and hourly movement breaks\n",
       "Week 3-4: Add 2-3 quick break exercises during the workday\n",
       "Week 5-8: Incorporate 20-30 minute exercise routines 3 times per week\n",
       "Week 9-12: Refine lifestyle modifications including sleep and stress management\n",
