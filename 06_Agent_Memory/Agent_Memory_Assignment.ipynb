    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "the checkpointer is thread specific. it only exists for that thread's lifetime, and cannot cross threads. it can also grow very large if not trimmed, as every single message in the conversation is saved. it's best for specific details that are only relevant in that session, and that do not need to persist. \n",

    "memory store persists data across threads. it is not automatic, but explicit, in that data must be chosen to store. only specific data points are stored. it is persistent until explicitly deleted. this is best for user profile data, preferences, and historical patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "long term memory may have more privacy concerns, as it persists indefinitely, so would likely need data retention policies in place and inform users. it also requires careful access control to ensure there is no sharing across interactions or users. short term memory is much less likely to be accessed by another user, as the conversation is destroyed once the thread ends. \n",

      "Reducing stress is a great goal, and there are several effective strategies you can try. Here are some evidence-based methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It can boost your mood and improve your overall health. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deep Breathing**: Simple deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which of these strategies resonate with you? Or is there a specific area of your life where you feel the most stress?\n"

      "3. **Pelvic Tilts**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently flatten your lower back against the floor by tilting your pelvis upward. Hold for a few seconds, then release. Repeat 10-15 times to strengthen your core and support your back.\n",

    "- Privacy implications of storing interaction data\n",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "explicit feedback is the strongest signal. thumbs up and thumbs down, explicit verbal feedback, and star ratings or satisfaction scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "implicit feedback is also important. follow up questions such as the user asking for more details or clarification. this shows engagement. confirmation from the user that they tried the suggestion from the llm and it was successful, or worked for them. more engagement and longer conversations may also indicate a positive/successful interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "successful interactions share patterns. in the response, it's best to provide a structured format, specific alternatives, safety considerations, and actionable steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "for a wellness interaction specifically, it would be good to store interactions where the user reported positive outcomes from the advice. if the user did not receive a positive outcome, it is still good to store that interaction and information, so it can be used to readjust in the future. it would be beneficial to track and store any stated goals and progress as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "while storing this information could lead to better outcomes and user satisfaction, it's also important to consider the privacy factor. one would likely not want to store sensitive user information, medical information, and anything personally identifiable, and would also not want to use that information in the prompt to an llm. \n",
    "\n",

    "long-term memory, semantic memory, episodic memory, and procedural memory need persistent storage, and can use postgres to accomplish this. short-term memory such as conversation history, can use PostgresSaver or MemorySaver. \n",
    "\n",
    "user specific data, such as user_id, profile information like name, age, allergies, etc, user preferences, and tracked metrics and metadata need to be in persistent storage. this information needs to persist across sessions and threads. it's a much better user experience, and also important for safety with a wellness agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "a structured response format would be good to be shared by all agents as well. if there were positive feedback, explicit or implicit, it would be good to share that amongst all agents to improve user satisfaction and the effectiveness of the multi agent system. \n",
    "\n",
    "postgres can be accessed by multiple agents, and thus the agents can retrieve relevant stored data. all agents must see the same user profile. things like allergies and injuries are relevant to all agents. this must also be immediately available to all agents as well. if there is an update or change in some of this information, the data should be injected into the system prompt for the next agent to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "each agent will have different experiences with the user, so each would learn and store data from its domain specific interactions. an exercise agent's episodes don't necessariliy need to immediately affect the nutrition agent's behavior or response in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "this workbook recommends ttl policies for memory expiration and cleanup. short-term conversation hisotry should expire after 30-90 days of inactivity. long-term user profile data should not delete unless explicitly chosen by the user. episodic memory should keep the most recent/relevant episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "a clear namespace pattern is important for sharing knowledge and data between the agents. (user_id, \"category\") for user specific data like (user_id, \"profile\") and (user_id, \"preferences\"). shared knowledge uses (\"wellness\", \"knowledge\") accessible to all agents. agent specific learning uses (\"agent_name\", \"episodes\") like (\"exercise_agent\", \"episodes\") to prevent agents from corrupting each other's learning."

      "Assistant:\n",
      "This week, your wellness metrics indicate some areas of concern:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mood**: Your average mood is at 6.5/10, with a slight decline, suggesting you may be feeling less positive than usual.\n",
      "2. **Energy**: Your energy levels are averaging 5.5/10, also showing a decline, which may be affecting your overall motivation and activity.\n",
      "3. **Sleep Quality**: At an average of 4.5/10, your sleep quality is below optimal, indicating you may not be getting enough restorative rest.\n",
      "4. **Stress**: Your stress levels are averaging 6.5/10, but there is a slight improvement, which is a positive sign.\n",
      "5. **Exercise**: You’re averaging only 10 minutes of exercise per day, which is below the recommended 30 minutes for optimal health.\n",

      "\n",
      "Assistant:\n",
      "Feeling tired can be challenging, especially with your current metrics. Here are three actionable tips to help boost your energy and improve your overall wellness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prioritize Sleep**: Aim for a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Create a calming bedtime routine, such as reading or meditating, to signal to your body that it's time to wind down.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Short Exercise Breaks**: Even a few minutes of physical activity can help increase your energy levels. Try to include quick bursts of movement, like 10 jumping jacks or a brisk walk outside, to get your blood flowing and boost your mood.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stay Hydrated and Snack Wisely**: Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day. Additionally, opt for healthy snacks like nuts or fruit to provide sustained energy without the crash.\n",
      "\n",

      "User: How is my sleep improving? What should I keep doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant:\n",
      "While your sleep quality is currently below optimal (averaging 4.5/10), it's important to focus on strategies that can help improve it. Here are a few practices to continue or implement based on sleep hygiene principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a Sleep-Conducive Environment**: Ensure your bedroom is cool (ideally between 65-68°F or 18-20°C), dark, and quiet. Consider using blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block out light, and earplugs or a white noise machine to minimize noise disturbances.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Establish a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine**: Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading, gentle stretching, or meditation. This can help signal to your body that it's time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: Try to avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light emitted can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these practices, you can work towards improving your sleep quality. Would you like to discuss any specific strategies in more detail?\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
